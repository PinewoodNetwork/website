The planned network ‚å¨
===================

Before I can purchase any hardware I would need to firstly actually define what type of network I want to build at the end
of the day, what I want to experiment with when using the network as a homelab and what services I want to host and make
available.

So without any skirting around the issue - **let's begin!**

## Topology

I believe the best way to start discussing a network is to start at the physical level (just as the OSI layer would in anycase
such as to make a comparison) and provide a somewhat detailed topology of the network I want to setup - which routers will be
connected to eachother and which nodes to each of these routers.

The general topology consists of 6 routers denotated as $D_n$ where $n \{e \in Z | 1 \le e \le 6 \}$ is the number of the router.

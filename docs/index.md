Pinewood âŽ‡
===========

**Hoe lyk dit** partner, welcome to my humble-abode which _Pinewood_! I, [deavmi](https://deavmi.assigned.network), decided to put
together a little site documenting my progress in upgrading to enterprise-grade level hardware and th experiments I attempted with
them in order to further my knowledge on routing, switching and everything in-between. The final form that this project takes would
be that of documentation of a great fun that is networking but also at the same time a usable network that I slowly but surely transition
to.
